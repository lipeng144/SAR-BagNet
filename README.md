 # SAR-bagnet with PyTorch

PyTorch implementation of SAR-bagnet

## Requirements
   pytorch
   python 3.6+
   The training model requires a video card with more than 28G video memory
The SAR-BagNet model is present in the SAR-BagNet.py
#start
1.Unzip the image. we provide the MSTAR data in the images folder
2.run trian_test.py.The training process is the same as a traditional CNN
3.utils.py can generate heatmaps of each SAR images
